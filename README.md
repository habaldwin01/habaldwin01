## Shwmae! 👋

I'm a Research Software Engineer based at the UK's National Oceanography Centre. My research interests include embedded computing, computer vision and bioinformatics. I'm currently working on real-time organism identification and tracking for autonomous undersea vehicles, alongside shipboard systems for rapid, automated plankton identification.
